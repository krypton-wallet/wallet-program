- initialize ProfileHeader with given info and serialize into pda data

ProfileHeader format:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <strong>name</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Byte position in pda data </strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>description</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Default value</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>recovery_threshold
   </td>
   <td>0
   </td>
   <td>Minimum number of guardians needed to recover
   </td>
   <td>3
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

   </td>
   <td>1~4
   </td>
   <td>Preset space to store the size of vector
   </td>
   <td>n
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Vector of guardians
   </td>
   <td>5~(n*32+5)
   </td>
   <td>Vector of guardian pubkeys
   </td>
   <td>-

### Recover wallet

Purpose: enter recovery mode by moving all info from old pda to new pda seeded with new authority

- Get PDA of old authority
- Create new profile account with new pda
